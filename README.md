Block chain Land/Property Registry

Description
Land/properties sale and ownership is a very time-consuming process involving many middlemen, thus increasing chances of fraud. These problems can subsequently be prevented by use of Block chain technology which I will demonstrate within this project.

Overview
The system will entail all activities from ownership, transfer, land and construction permits.

System content (system boundaries)
•	Land sale
•	Land ownership
•	Land rates of the land in question
•	Construction permits of the land in question
Interactions
•	Governments and involved municipalities
•	Tax and law institutes and bodies in case of queries
•	Private companies
•	Potential buyers/sellers

Product features
•	Elimination third parties therefore faster process
•	Reduce fraud 
•	Easier audits and levies collection

i will start my implementation with a simple bank to get an understanding of how to implement the above project
